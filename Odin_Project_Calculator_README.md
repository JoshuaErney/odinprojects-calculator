# Odin Project Calculator

A calculator project developed as part of the Odin Project curriculum. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and is designed to reinforce HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Build a functional calculator capable of basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and JavaScript fundamentals.

- [x] Style the calculator using CSS.
- [ ] Implement the functions for the basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- [ ] Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons.
- [ ] Create the functions that handle the operator buttons.
- [ ] Create the function that handles the equals button.
- [ ] Create the function that handles the clear button.
- [ ] Add a function to handle decimal points.
- [ ] Add a function to handle keyboard input.
- [ ] Ensure the calculator can handle multiple operations and respects the order of operations.

## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

### What I Learned

This project solidified my understanding of DOM manipulation, event listeners, and fundamental JavaScript operations. Implementing edge cases (like division by zero) provided additional insights into JavaScript error handling.

### Continued Development

Future improvements could include more complex mathematical functions, keyboard support, and a refined user interface for better user experience.
